### Routes
- **Attributes**: `rid` (PK, auto_increment), `tid` (FK), `origin`, `dest`, `departure`, `arrival`, `base_price`
- **Description**: Contains route information including origin and destination stations, departure and arrival times, and the base ticket price.

### Customers
- **Attributes**: `cid` (PK, auto_increment), `cname`, `concession_class`, `age`
- **Description**: Stores customer information including their name, age, and concession category which determines discount eligibility.

- **Attributes**: `pid` (PK), `ptype`, `amount`, `ptime`
- **Description**: Records payment transactions with unique payment ID, payment type, amount, and timestamp of the transaction.

### Bookings
- **Attributes**: `pnr` (PK, auto_increment), `cid` (FK), `pid` (FK), `btype`, `seat_class`, `seat_number`, `time_of_booking`
- **Description**: Tracks ticket bookings with PNR number, customer ID, payment ID, booking type (normal/RAC), seat information, and booking timestamp.

### BookingsRoutes
- **Attributes**: `pnr`, `rid` (FK)
- **Description**: Junction table linking bookings to routes, allowing a single booking to include multiple route segments.

### Cancellations
- **Attributes**: Same as Bookings plus `refund_id`
- **Description**: Records cancelled bookings with their original details and tracks refund status through `refund_id`.

### RACPromotionQueue
- **Attributes**: `pnr` (PK), `seat_number`

- **Description**: Manages the booking cancellation process by recording cancellation details, determining refund eligibility, and processing RAC ticket promotions when seats become available.

## Normalization

### Trains
- **1NF**: ✅ All attributes are atomic and table has a primary key (`tid`).
- **2NF**: ✅ All non-key attributes (`tname`, `first_class`, `second_class`) are fully dependent on the primary key.
- **3NF**: ✅ No transitive dependencies exist; all attributes directly depend on the primary key.
- **BCNF**: ✅ Every determinant is a candidate key.

### Routes
- **1NF**: ✅ All attributes are atomic and table has a primary key (`rid`).
- **2NF**: ✅ All non-key attributes fully depend on the primary key.
- **3NF**: ✅ No obvious transitive dependencies.
- **BCNF**: ✅ Every determinant is a candidate key.

### Customers
- **1NF**: ✅ All attributes are atomic and table has a primary key (`cid`).
- **2NF**: ✅ All non-key attributes (`cname`, `concession_class`, `age`) fully depend on the primary key.
- **3NF**: ✅ No transitive dependencies exist.
- **BCNF**: ✅ Every determinant is a candidate key.

### Payments
- **1NF**: ✅ All attributes are atomic and table has a primary key (`pid`).
- **2NF**: ✅ All non-key attributes fully depend on the primary key.
- **3NF**: ✅ No transitive dependencies exist.
- **BCNF**: ✅ Every determinant is a candidate key.

### Bookings
- **1NF**: ✅ All attributes are atomic and table has a primary key (`pnr`).
- **2NF**: ✅ All non-key attributes fully depend on the primary key.
- **3NF**: ✅ No obvious transitive dependencies, as cid and pid are foreign keys representing relationships rather than transitive dependencies.
- **BCNF**: ✅ Every determinant is a candidate key.

### BookingsRoutes
- **1NF**: ✅ All attributes are atomic.
- **2NF**: ✅ This is a junction table linking bookings to routes with no non-key attributes.
- **3NF**: ✅ No non-key attributes means no transitive dependencies.
- **BCNF**: ✅ The combination of pnr and rid effectively forms the primary key.

### Cancellations
- **1NF**: ✅ All attributes are atomic and table has a primary key (`pnr`).
- **2NF**: ✅ All non-key attributes fully depend on the primary key.
- **3NF**: ✅ No transitive dependencies.
- **BCNF**: ✅ Every determinant is a candidate key.

### RACPromotionQueue
- **1NF**: ✅ All attributes are atomic and table has a primary key (`pnr`).
- **2NF**: ✅ This is a temporary queue table with just two fields where seat_number depends on pnr.
- **3NF**: ✅ No transitive dependencies.
- **BCNF**: ✅ Every determinant is a candidate key.
